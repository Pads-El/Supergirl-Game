# Supergirl-Game

###  Intro

Very basic game concept strictly for me to learn some Unreal. Figured I would share the progress here and hopefuly I can get some initial feedback. Will be looking to share whatever I create to garner even further feedback.

#### Dev stack

- Blender (Modelling)
- Reallusion (CC 4.2 and IC 8.2 (Characeter Creator and animations))
- Marvelous Designer (Clothing design and sim)
- InstMat (Texturing)
- Unreal Engine 5 (Game Engine)
